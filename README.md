## Motivation

In my search and need to write better, more maintainable and more scalable JavaScript, I came across a series of articles by [Derek Greer](https://github.com/derekgreer) which were written in 2011. In this series, he explains how to write JavaScript with [OOP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming) standards, using [SOLID](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID_(object-oriented_design)) principles. He gives examples of code that can be considered as Spaghetti and gives solution to how to refactor that code according to the said principles.

Using this articles and code examples as my starting point, I created this repo, which includes modernized and tweaked versions of said examples. In near feature, I hope to expand this repo, with more examples and information about these architectural viewpoints.

Original articles by [Derek Greer](https://github.com/derekgreer) can be found here: [Link](http://aspiringcraftsman.com/2011/12/08/solid-javascript-single-responsibility-principle/)

## How to Use

Each folder contains a link that contains a piece of code which can be considered as "not that good". The repo contains refactored code. By examining these side by side, some insight can be gained about using SOLID principles with JavaScript code.
